  "PrimaryOutcomes" : "Safety run-inThe main goal of this study is to determine safety of IMM-101 and SBRT in patients with limited metastatic disease in the lung and/or liver from PDAC. The toxicity of IMM-101 and SBRT is defined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5). Safety will be assessed in terms of grade 3, 4 and 5 events related to the IMM-101 vaccination or SBRT before, during and after IMM-101 and SBRT in patients included in the standard and expansion cohort. With a sample size of 20 (10 per cohort), we will be able to estimate a toxicity rate of 10 % to within a 95% confidence interval of [1.2%, 31.7%] using the binomial exact method. This means at 95% confidence level max. up to 6 patients out of 20 patients can be allowed to have grade 3/4/5 toxicity. If up to a maximum of 6 patients out of 20 develop AEs related to IMM-101 administration, then we feel that including the remaining patients in the phase II study testing efficacy is warranted. All grade 3, 4 and 5 events related to the administration of the IMM-101 product will be considered events for this endpoint.Phase IIThe main endpoint of the second inclusion phase is to asses efficacy of IMM-101 therapy and SBRT in patients with limited metastatic disease in the lungs and/or liver from PDAC. Efficacy will be determined using 1-year progression free survival. Progression free survival will be calculated from the start FOLFIRINOX to the date of death. With a power of 0,80 and ? of 0.05 a total of 56 (standard cohort) and 44 (expansion cohort) (including patients of the safety run-in patients will be included in the phase II study to determine an increase of the 1-year progression-free survival from 12% to 24% (standard cohort) and 5% to 15% (expansion cohort) (Fleming’s procedure).

  "PrimaryOutcomes" : "The primary endpoint is to compare dose intensity of the 3-weekly and the weekly schedules after 18 weeks of planned therapy.The defininition of dose intensity is based upon the total dose the patient actually receives in relation to the total dose that the patient is expected to receive by 18 weeks of therapy. This definition applies to patients discontinuing therapy for reasons other than disease progression. For patients stopping treatment due to lack of efficacy, dose-intensity is based on the total dose received over the interval of time from the start of chemotherapy until the date of the last dose given. Both treatment arms are designed to have the same dose-intensity at the outset ie 150 mg/m2 as the total dose given over 18 weeks representing 100 % dose intensity in relation to the planned total dose at the start of treatment. Dose delays, dose reductions and especially stopping treatment for reasons other than disease progression will be mirrored by lowering the dose given in relation to the dose planned and as such is an objective measure of drug tolerability.",
  "SecondaryOutcomes" : "Overall SurvivalDisease Specific SurvivalProgression Free SurvivalProgression free survival is defined as the length of time from randomization to the first documentation of one of the following:PSA progression; rPain progression; rDeath due to any cause; rRadiological disease progressionPSA progression is defined as either a 25% increase (at least 2 ng/ml) from baseline in patients not achieving a prior > 50% decrease in PSA or a 50% increase in PSA (at least 2 ng/ml) above the nadir value in patients who have achieved a prior > 50% decrease in PSA. A confirmatory PSA will be taken at least 3 weeks later. During the first twelve weeks of therapy increases in PSA may reflect treatment induced PSA-flare and can therefore be misleading. A rising PSA, during the first 12 weeks of treatment, without clinical and/or radiological signs of progression is therefore not considered as disease progression.Pain will be assessed using the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale (see appendix). Pain assessment will be made at baseline and before each treatment until the patient discontinues therapy. Diaries will be used to assess analgesic consumption. Pain progression is defined as;  the need for palliative radiotherapy if the symptoms giving rise to radiotherapy were not present at baseline or;  they were present but the pain have worsened to the extent that the physician in question feels that it is in the patients best interest to radiate. Pain progression exists when the patients`;  median PPI score increases by at least one point from nadir or;  there is an increase in analgesic consumption of 25% over baseline.Radiological disease progression and tumour response are defined according to Recist 1.1 criteria. If lesions are present only in bone and assessed by bone scan, size and intensity of target lesions may not be used to determine disease progression. The appearance of two new lesions confirmed six weeks later is considered as disease progression.PSA ResponseOnly considered after 12 weeks of treatment. PSA response is defined as a 50% or greater decline in serum PSA from baseline given that baseline PSA is at least 10 ng/ml.Quality of LifeQuality of life will be assessed using the FACT-P-T self administered questionnaire. Patients will complete the questionnaire at baseline and the day before the three week general assessments. The questionnaire is to be answered at home.Dose Intensity at 24 and 36 weeksDose intensity is defined in the same manner as for the primary endpoint.TolerabilityThe primary endpoint in this protocol is chosen as a means of estimating tolerability. Another estimate of tolerability will be made by examining the frequency of patients requiring a dose reduction, a dose delay as well as patients. At each cycle of therapy evaluation, three questions will apply:Is the patient stopping treatment for reasons of toxicity and not disease progression?Is there a dose delay due to toxicity?Is there dose reduction?If the answer is yes to any of the three questions, this will be recorded as an event. A patient may subsequently have more than one event, (i.e. dose delay (1 ev.), dose reduction (1 event), stopping treatment (1 event)Duration of TreatmentDuration of treatment is defined as the length of time from the first day of treatment to the last day of treatment with cabazitaxel.Efficacy of cabazitaxel in relation to the total cumulative dose of prior treatment with docetaxelEfficacy endpoints described above will be correlated to the cumulative dosage of docetaxel prior to study treatmentFrequency and time to skeletal related events",

  "SecondaryOutcomes" : "Overall Response Rate (ORR): Disease response will be assessed throughout the study by anatomic imaging evaluation and physical exam of visible/palpable tumor. Overall tumor response will be assessed using Enhanced RECIST 1.1 at the designated time points. The portion of patients with tumor size reduction predefined by RECIST 1.1, including patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), will be evaluated.;  Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR): Disease control rates (DCR), which include stable disase (SD) as a response measure offer additional advantages over ORRs, since they are also associated with overall survival (OS) in breast cancer. During clinical development of Eribulin, SD lasting > 6 months was used to assess CBR as CR + PR + SD (?6 months). Since the same criteria were used to assess vintafolide activity in initial monotherapy trials in ovarian cancer, the CBR for this trial will be defined as CR + PR + SD (?6 months).; Overall Survival (OS): OS data defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause will be collected as a universally accepted direct measure of benefit.;  Safety: The study will use standard endpoints that allow one to see results in context for comparison with large historical databases. Safety and tolerability of vintafolide in multiple indications will be assessed in advanced cancer subjects. Monitoring will include complete blood counts, serum chemistry, vital signs, physical exam, ECGs, and ECOG performance status.;  Pharmackokinetic Endpoints: For the initial dose of vintafolide and paclitaxel for each subject, plasma concentration-time profiles will be determined following IV administration. The following PK parameters will be determined for vintafolide and paclitaxel: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax); area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC); and if feasible, half-life (t1/2); total body clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd). In addition, descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations at designated time points will be provided.",

The denominator for DoR will be defined as described for ORR.;  Disease control rate (DCR) at 4, 6 or 12 months is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best objective response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first 4, 6 or 12 months, respectively, or who have demonstrated SD (Stable disease) for a minimum interval of 16, 24 or 52 weeks, following randomization. As additional analysis, DCR at 6 months will also be assessed as % of patients who have a BoR of CR or PR in the first 6 months or who have demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 12 weeks following randomization.;  Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment.;  Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive.Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of data cut-off (DCO) for the analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is post the DCO date, these patients will be censored at the date of DCO. Death dates may be found by checking publicly available death registries.;  Best objective response (BoR) is calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST assessment. It is the best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression (or confirmed progression where applicable) or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression. CR or PR must be confirmed. BoR will be determined programmatically based on RECIST using ICR data using all data up until the first progression event.
